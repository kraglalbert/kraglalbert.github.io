What's this? A blog post? The thing everyone in tech is doing nowadays?

...

Pretty much, yeah. This blog will be my attempt at writing about things that I would probably enjoy reading myself; that is a lot easier said than done, but I'll try.

Since this is my first post, I figured I would talk a bit about how this website came to be. In classic fashion, the idea to make this whole thing came a few days ago, right at the start of finals season when my free time was already getting pretty close to zero. I had thought of making a personal website in the past, but for some reason the idea actually stuck this time. After brainstorming ideas for a bit and thinking about what I wanted it to look like, I (foolishly) got started. One small issue though:

I suck at frontend stuff.

<br>

I'm pretty good at algorithms and all that, but the Holy Trinity of HTML/CSS/Javascript historically hasn't been my thing. After initially trying to implement the whole website from scratch, I caved about 24 hours later and decided to use a nice Jekyll template instead, which is what you're seeing now. It looks probably about 100 times better, and I even managed to recycle some of the code I wrote initially, which was nice. 

However, at the time of writing this, the website design under-the-hood is definitely **not** good. Pretty much anything that's well done can be attributed to the template, and the rest is just me messing around with stuff I don't really understand yet. My resume page might look okay now, but the way I implemented that probably isn't great.

There's a point I'm trying to make here though: even though I don't really know what I'm doing, I still decided to just jump in and do it anyway! I would argue that that is one of the best and fastest ways to learn, especially with programming. It can be scary to use something new and unknown, but you've got to start somewhere or you'll be stuck forever.

Hopefully I follow my own advice here, because I've got a lot to learn about before my frontend game becomes at all decent. But I'm excited for the journey!
