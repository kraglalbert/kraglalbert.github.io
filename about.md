I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at McGill University, currently studying Software Engineering. I also do music and ultimate frisbee.

#### tech:

Before university, my only experience with coding came from building an iPhone app in the 10th grade. Over the course of a year I somehow managed to put a functioning product together (with a lot of help from my dad), and I was pretty proud of the end result. Then, I didn't do any coding for the next two and a half years.

My first proper experience with programming came in my second semester of first year, when I took COMP 202. I learned a lot of the fundamentals, and I was officially on my way with my (at the time) Computer Engineering major.

I did my first software internship in summer 2018 at a small but fast-growing adtech company, which was a great experience. I learned a lot in the span of a few months and got a glimpse into what the real world of software development was like. It was around this time I decided to switch into Software Engineering as well, and I've had no regrets so far.

I was a Software Engineer Intern at Facebook this past summer at their Menlo Park office, and I'll be returning as an intern in Seattle next summer.

#### music:

I started playing guitar in 2008, when I decided to take classical guitar lessons. I don't remember quite why I started, but I do know that I quickly began to love the instrument. I also never really took to classical music too much, since 13-year-old me preferred to listen to lots of AC/DC instead. After a couple of years, I stopped taking lessons and became self-taught.

Learning guitar has been one of the most rewarding journeys I've experienced so far. What started as a passion for guitar slowly but surely became a passion for music; nowadays I run a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheFenderrocker" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> where I post guitar covers and remixes, and I've also released some original music on things like Spotify, iTunes, etc. I self-taught myself essentially everything about music production and recording as well, and I'm pretty happy with the quality I'm able to produce nowadays.

#### ultimate frisbee:

Ultimate frisbee (usually known as just Ultimate) entered my life when I started high school. Since then, I've played on several high-level teams, including the British Columbia provincial team, Manic (one of the top club teams in Montreal), and the McGill Ultimate Team.
