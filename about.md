Hey, I'm Albert.

I'm a 24-year-old Canadian with Serbian parents who is currently living in the U.S. I graduated from McGill University in 2021 with a degree in Software Engineering and I'm now working as a software engineer full-time.

In my free time I like to focus on music—playing guitar, writing songs, mixing—and I also like to play chess, cook, grind Rocket League, and write. This website is primarily my outlet for writing.
